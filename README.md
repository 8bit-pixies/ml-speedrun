# Machine Learning Speedrun

Speedrunning Machine Learning

In this speedrun I'll attempt to re-implement a number of algorithms which define the "bread-and-butter" of what a data scientist should know (maybe). I will use vanilla "numpy" to implement the following...

*  linear models (logistic regression?)
*  decision trees
*  boosting/stacking of some variation
*  convolution networks
*  some kind of hacked version of u-net for image segmentation

I won't be using any frameworks (besides reading in data), and will probably have to implement some framework (rather badly) from scratch - so we'll see how we go. 

The question really will be how far will I get?

-----

The scoring system will be based on some benchmark datasets. 

*  We'll use iris dataset, and newsgroup to start off with for the easier algorithms
*  (If I get there) the image data will be based on Pascal VOC 2005: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2005/index.html, which will support both classification and image segmentation tasks
